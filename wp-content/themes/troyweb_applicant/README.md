Monotone is a flexible, modular WordPress theme that leverages the power of Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for layout configuration. It uses a modern Vite asset build process for SCSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript, and all fonts are served directly from the theme, ensuring a consistent and fast user experience.

## Features

- **ACF Flexible Content Fields**: Monotone uses ACF to provide a block-based layout system. Each block comes with its own configuration settings, allowing for a high degree of customization. All
  field settings are backed up by a JSON file, making it easy to import and export configurations.

- **Vite Build System**: Monotone uses Vite as its build system, providing fast and efficient compilation of assets. It supports both editor and admin style options, compiled from SCSS.

- **Fonts Served from Theme Directory**: To ensure a consistent user experience and faster load times, all fonts are served directly from the theme directory.

- **Custom Branding Options**: Monotone provides custom branding options in the Customizer, allowing you to easily customize the site's logo, colors, and more.

- **Responsive Image Markup**: Monotone handles the image sizes, conversion to WEBP, and responsive image markup.

- **Custom Shortcodes**: Monotone includes custom shortcodes in the MCE editor for easy content creation.

- **Bootstrap Menu Walker**: Monotone uses the WP Bootstrap Navwalker to create a Bootstrap-enabled menu.

## Build Setup

The theme uses npm for package management. To get started, navigate to the `assets` directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To build the project and watch for changes, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

In addition to the main build, there are two additional builds for the editor and admin styles. These are built with SCSS and are located in the `assets/scss` directory.

```bash
npm run editor
npm run admin
```

You can build all the assets at once by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build-all
```
